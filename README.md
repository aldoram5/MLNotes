# Machine Learning Notes
A repository where I'll upload some notes about Machine Learning to document my learning and also to have something to comeback to later. Expect python scripts and Jupiter notebooks as well as Markdown docs. This repo is public for easy access and if anyone finds it helpful, however, these notes are intended to make sense to me, so don't expect this to be course like.
